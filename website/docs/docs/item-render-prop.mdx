# Item render prop

Both the `header` and `children` props of `AccordionItem` component support the
[render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) pattern, which can be used to
access item state, along with a `toggle` function to open or close the current item.

<AccessingState />

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{transformCodeBlock(source)}</CodeBlock>

:::tip

While this technique is useful for rendering dynamic content based on item state, in most
cases you won't need it for styling purpose. The `className` prop itself accepts a render
prop form which can be used to apply class selectors based on state. Please see the
[styling docs](./styling).
